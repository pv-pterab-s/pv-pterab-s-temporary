ArrayFire is a general-purpose tensor library that simplifies the process of
software development for the parallel architectures found in CPUs, GPUs, and
other hardware acceleration devices. The library serves users in every technical
computing market.

Several of ArrayFire's benefits include:

* Hundreds of accelerated [tensor computing functions](https://arrayfire.org/docs/group__arrayfire__func.htm), in the following areas:
    * Array handling
    * Computer vision
    * Image processing
    * Linear algebra
    * Machine learning
    * Standard math
    * Signal Processing
    * Statistics
